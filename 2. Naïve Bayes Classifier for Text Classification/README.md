# Naïve Bayes Classifier for Text Classification

This folder contains code for a project that uses the Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify text documents into their respective categories.

## Dataset:

The job description is an essential part of the recruitment process, and chunking down the job description into smaller parts Still, the job description is an essential part of the recruitment process, and chunking down the job description into smaller parts but important part parts can help CRM-based companies with their down-stream services which play a vital role in deciding the skill score and fit score of a candidate CRM-based companies can also use this for forming effective summaries. Anyone will prefer to get the context of the entire big blob of description in short.

 ## Project Goal:

The goal of this project is to learn Naïve Bayes Classifier. 

The project code also does the following:

1.Experimenting with the effect of smoothing on the accuracy of the model.
2.Deriving top 10 words for each category.

Document in the form of a blog post explaining the project and the results.
## Usage:

code is in the form of jupyter notebook. You can run the notebook using the following command:

    jupyter notebook

It will open the jupyter notebook in your browser. You can run the code cells in the notebook.
