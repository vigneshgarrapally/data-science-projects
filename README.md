# data-science-projects

This repository contains a collection of data science projects that I have worked on. The projects cover a range of topics, including data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and more.

## Projects

1. Project 1: Image Classification-Caltech101 dataset
2. Project 2: Na√Øve Bayes Classifier for Text Classification
3. Project 3: Image Classification-Wild Animal Dataset


Each project is organized into a separate folder with its own README file that provides a brief overview of the project, its objectives, and the techniques used. The README files also include instructions on how to replicate the results, as well as any necessary dependencies.

## Datasets

This repository also includes a collection of datasets that I have used for these projects. These datasets are located in the datasets folder and are organized by topic.
